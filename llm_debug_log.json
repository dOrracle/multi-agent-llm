Review the current state and verify the existing solutions to tasks already completed in the graph.\n\nTask Exploration and Verification: You are free to:\nDecompose tasks into subtasks to address specific components of the problem more effectively.\nTry out different strategies to move forward or explore new angles.\nVerify existing findings to ensure their validity and relevance.\n\nStrategic Decision Making: Based on your review of the current state, decide whether:\nMore exploration is needed (e.g., to investigate new avenues or gather additional information),\nFurther verification is required (e.g., to confirm the accuracy of prior results),\nOr clarification is necessary (e.g., to resolve ambiguities or refine understanding).\n\nReaching a Solution: Once the graph has reached a verified solution, propose a final task that consolidates all findings and directly answers the question.

Each task should represent a distinct approach and should not depend on other tasks you generate.\n\nClarity and Focus: Make sure each task is clearly defined and focuses on a specific aspect of the problem. Ensure that the scope of each task is narrow and specific enough to guide further exploration.\n\nAvoid Redundancy: Ensure that each task adds a unique perspective to solving the problem.\n\nTask Descriptions: For each task, provide a detailed description of the strategy or sub-task. Explain how it contributes to solving the question and why it is important in the context of the overall problem-solving process.\n\nLimit the Number of Tasks: You are limited to generating no more than 1 tasks at this stage.\n\nDo Not Provide a Final Answer: At this point, your goal is not to provide the final answer but to identify different potential approaches for tackling the question.\n\nIf the question is combinatorial, you can propose multiple strategies.\nIf the question involves multiple contexts, you can create relevant sub-tasks for each context.\nIf the question is simple, you can justify that the task is simple, and propose that the final solution can be obtained in the next step.\n",
