       "  explanation: Without access to real-time data, determining which city in California had the most rainfall in 2024 requires looking at alternative sources or using historical information. Often, cities like Eureka, Crescent City, and other North Coast regions receive higher annual rainfall due to their location and climate characteristics. Historical trends might suggest these regions are likely candidates for high rainfall. To get specific information for 2024, databases or annual reports published by the National Weather Service, the California Department of Water Resources, or academic climate research organizations could provide the needed data. However, without real-time access, a definitive answer cannot be provided at this moment.\n",

Often, cities like Eureka, Crescent City, and other North Coast regions receive higher annual rainfall due to their location and climate characteristics. Historical trends might suggest these regions are likely candidates for high rainfall. To get specific information for 2024, databases or annual reports published by the National Weather Service, the California Department of Water Resources, or academic climate research organizations could provide the needed data.

Solving this analytically for exact roots is challenging due to the non-polynomial components, specifically the \\( \\sqrt{x} \\) and \\( -\\frac{6}{x} \\) terms. These terms suggest that simple polynomial root-finding techniques are not applicable. However, we can approach the problem using numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or computational tools like MATLAB or Python with libraries such as SciPy, which can handle such transcendental equations. Root-finding would require setting a reasonable domain for possible real roots and iteratively applying numerical techniques. Alternatively, plotting the function to visually identify any approximate solutions can be a helpful step before precision approximation. However, without specific computations here, we cannot provide exact roots. Therefore, for a definitive answer, computational tools are recommended to solve this set graphically or numerically within a specified domain.\n",

       "  explanation: The given function, \\( f(x) = 3x^5 - 7x^4 + 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 11\\sqrt{x} - \\frac{6}{x} + 2 \\), is a complex mix of polynomial, irrational, and fractional terms. Solving this analytically for exact roots is challenging due to the non-polynomial components, specifically the \\( \\sqrt{x} \\) and \\( -\\frac{6}{x} \\) terms. These terms suggest that simple polynomial root-finding techniques are not applicable. However, we can approach the problem using numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or computational tools like MATLAB or Python with libraries such as SciPy, which can handle such transcendental equations. Root-finding would require setting a reasonable domain for possible real roots and iteratively applying numerical techniques. Alternatively, plotting the function to visually identify any approximate solutions can be a helpful step before precision approximation. However, without specific computations here, we cannot provide exact roots. Therefore, for a definitive answer, computational tools are recommended to solve this set graphically or numerically within a specified domain.\n",
