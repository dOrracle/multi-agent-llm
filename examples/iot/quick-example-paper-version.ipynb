       "                        <p><span class='label ida-label'>IDA:</span> Let&#x27;s clarify the interaction process and the parameters involved. The annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with CMB photons is significant when the energies involved exceed the rest mass energy threshold for electron-positron pair production. We have calculated the threshold energy for a single high-energy gamma photon, but we need to check whether to consider combined energies of both gamma photons in the interaction framework. Also, evaluate energy scaling effects that may apply at high energies. Given the importance of the average CMB photon energy and how we scale up from MeV to GeV, we need to determine if the options provided make sense based on the calculations. Additionally, it&#x27;s critical to cross-verify if the plausible option B’s interactions stand against option A&#x27;s derivation in light of cosmic estimations.</p>\n",
