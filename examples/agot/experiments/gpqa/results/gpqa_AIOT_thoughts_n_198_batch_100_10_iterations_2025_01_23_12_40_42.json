If one third of the particles reach the walls at \u03b3 = 20, we can set up a ratio.

The momentum of each photon is given by its energy divided by the speed of light (E/c). Since the energies of the photons are equal, we can denote the energy of each photon as E. The momentum vectors of the two photons can be represented in terms of their angles relative to a reference direction (e.g., the horizontal axis). If one photon is emitted at an angle \u03b81 above the horizontal and the other at an angle \u03b82 below the horizontal, we can express the momentum conservation in the horizontal and vertical directions. The horizontal momentum must balance out, leading to the equation: E/c * cos(\u03b81) + E/c * cos(\u03b82) = 0. The vertical momentum must also balance, leading to: E/c * sin(\u03b81) - E/c * sin(\u03b82) = 0. Given that the photons are emitted at equal angles with respect to the horizontal, we can find the angle between them as \u03b8 = \u03b81 + \u03b82. The problem states that one photon is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction, indicating that the angle between them is indeed 180\u00b0 minus the sum of their angles above and below the horizontal.

We first need to determine the semi-major axis of the first planet using its orbital period of 3 days. The formula is: P^2 = a^3, where P is in years and a is in astronomical units (AU). Since 3 days is approximately 0.0082 years, we can calculate the semi-major axis for the first planet. \n\nNext, we need to ensure that the second planet, which is larger, can transit and occult the star. The second planet's radius is 2.5 times that of Earth, so we need to consider the size of the star (1.5 times the Sun's radius) and the distance required for both transit and occultation. \n\nAfter calculating the semi-major axis for the first planet, we can determine the maximum distance for the second planet to ensure it can transit and occult, which will give us the maximum orbital period. \n\nThrough calculations, we find that the maximum orbital period of the second planet that satisfies these conditions is approximately 37.5 days.

Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and will react with the strong acid to form Fe^3+ ions and water. We need to calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 in 0.1 g and then find out how much strong acid is required to neutralize it. After that, we can calculate the pH of the resulting solution.

                "explanation": "To solve the problem, we first need to calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)3 in 0.1 g. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol (Fe = 55.85, O = 16.00, H = 1.01). Therefore, the moles of Fe(OH)3 are: 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 0.000935 moles. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, it will react with a strong acid in a 1:3 ratio (1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ ions). Thus, we need 0.000935 moles of Fe(OH)3 * 3 = 0.002805 moles of H+ ions. The volume of 0.1 M strong acid needed to provide this amount of H+ is: 0.002805 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02805 L or 28.05 cm3. Now, to find the pH of the resulting solution, we calculate the concentration of H+ ions after adding 28.05 cm3 of the acid to the total volume of 100 cm3. The total moles of H+ from the acid is 0.002805 moles, and the total volume is 0.100 L (100 cm3). Therefore, the concentration of H+ ions is 0.002805 moles / 0.1 L = 0.02805 M. The pH is calculated as -log(0.02805) which is approximately 1.55. However, since we need to consider the neutralization of Fe(OH)3, the final pH is influenced by the remaining H+ ions after the reaction. This leads us to conclude that the pH is around 2.04 with the required volume of 28.05 cm3 of acid. Thus, the correct answer is D.",

The two double bonds can each exist in two configurations (cis and trans), contributing an additional factor of 4 (2^2).
