The average speed of the particles measured as a fraction of light speed leads to a calculation of travel time for each particle to cover the radius of the detector before it decays. To calculate the new \\( \\gamma \\) needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the walls, we consider the formula for the decay length of the particles given by \\( \\, L = \\gamma \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau \\), where \\( \\tau \\) is the proper lifetime of the particle. Adjusting \\( \\gamma \\) will change the effective decay length and the number of particles reaching the walls.

In the new field along Y, the precession rate changes but remains proportional to the magnetic field strength.

The periodic shift in milliangstroms is proportional to the planet's orbital period. Since planet #1 has a shift of 5 miliangstroms and planet #2 has a shift of 7 miliangstroms, we can set up the ratio of orbital periods (T2/T1) based on these shifts. The periodic shifts relate to the orbital velocities, and thus to the periods of the planets by the ratio of these shifts: T2/T1 = 5/7. Thus, T2 is longer than T1 by a factor of (7/5).

The flux difference due to this temperature difference can be obtained using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. Since there is a 20% spot coverage, the equivalent brightness reduction will be proportional to the area of the spots.  \n2. **Determine the size of the planet**: Assuming the spots give brightness variation comparable to an exoplanet transit, the radius of the planet causing the same flux drop can be calculated from the observed flux drop due to the spots.
