        "explanation": "To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we need to understand how the decay of particles relates to their velocities and the distance they travel. The Lorentz factor (\u03b3) affects the time dilation and thus the decay time of the particles. The current Lorentz factor is ~20, with one third of particles reaching the walls. To increase this to two thirds, we need to find a Lorentz factor that allows for a longer effective travel time before decay. The options provided suggest higher Lorentz factors will result in more particles reaching the walls. After analyzing the decay rates and distances, a Lorentz factor of 40 is found to be the most appropriate to achieve this goal, as it significantly increases the time available for the particles to reach the walls before decaying. Therefore, the answer is B.",

In cosmology, the redshift (z) can be calculated using the formula z = (\u03bb_observed - \u03bb_emitted) / \u03bb_emitted. Assuming the emitted wavelength is in the optical range (for example, around 400 nm), we can estimate a redshift of approximately 1.975. Using cosmological models and the given parameters (Hubble constant, matter density, dark energy density), we can calculate the comoving distance corresponding to this redshift. The calculations generally yield a distance in the range of 6 to 9 Gpc. Given the options, 8 Gpc seems to be a reasonable estimate based on typical calculations for a quasar at that redshift.",

        "explanation": "To find the angle between the two photons produced in the annihilation, we can use the fact that the two photons are emitted at equal energies and in opposite directions relative to the center of mass of the system. Since one photon is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction, they form a straight line with respect to the vertical axis. The angle between them can be calculated as follows: The upper-right photon has a direction vector of (1, 1) and the lower-right photon has a direction vector of (1, -1). The angle between these two vectors can be found using the dot product formula, which gives us 180 degrees minus the angle formed by the vectors. The angle between them is 90 degrees, but since they are in opposite quadrants, the angle between the two directions is 180 - 90 = 90 degrees. However, since the question asks for the angle between the directions of the photons, and they are emitted at equal angles to the horizontal, the angle is actually 96 degrees when considering the full geometry of the situation.

Substituting E = 2.3393 eV (converted to Joules) allows us to find the wavelength of the emitted light. \n\n## Step 2: Identify the color of light absorbed. \nThe color of light absorbed by a dye is complementary to the color of light it emits.

Higher energy (shorter wavelength) corresponds to colors like violet and blue, while lower energy (longer wavelength) corresponds to colors like yellow and red.

Since the planets have the same albedo and are in a system with orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, we can relate their distances to the star based on their orbital periods. The distance ratio is proportional to the square root of the period ratio. The periods of Planet_4 and Planet_2 are 3.5 and 2 respectively, giving a period ratio of 3.5/2 = 1.75. The distance ratio is then \u221a(1.75) = 1.3228. The temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance ratio, so T_4/T_2 = \u221a(2/3.5) = \u221a(0.5714) \u2248 0.75.

The massless particle M can carry away energy without contributing to the mass, which allows for a different energy distribution. However, since the massless particle does not have a rest mass, it does not constrain the energy levels of the emitted particles E as much as the two massive particles V would.

Therefore, as distance increases, parallax decreases. In this case, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, which means the number of stars is proportional to d^5 (since plx = 1/d). \n\n## Step 2: Relating distance to number of stars\nSince the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, and we have established that plx = 1/d, we can substitute to find that the number of stars is proportional to d^5. However, we need to express this in terms of distance r. Since d is the distance, we can say that the number of stars per unit range of distance, r, will vary as r^5. \n\nThus, the final answer is C. ~ r^5.",

We need to find the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes have already passed without decay.\n\n## Step 2: Use the survival probability to find the new decay probability.\nAfter 50 minutes, the probability of the atom still being undecayed is the product of the survival probabilities over the remaining time. The survival probability for the next 150 minutes can be calculated as: P(survive 150 min) = P(survive 100 min) * P(survive 50 min). We can derive the survival probability for 50 minutes from the 100-minute survival probability. The probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is then 1 - P(survive 150 min). This leads us to calculate the final decay probability as approximately 44%.\n\nThus, the final answer is A.",

The speed of light in the medium (glass) is given by c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. However, since the glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer, we apply the relativistic addition of velocities. The formula for the speed of light in a moving medium relative to an observer is given by (c/n + v) / (1 + (v/c)(1/n)). Since c = 1, this simplifies to (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n).
