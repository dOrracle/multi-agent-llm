Therefore, the maternal grandfather of Vyacheslav Yaroslavich is Ingegerd Olofsdotter's father, who is King Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung of Sweden.\n\nNext, we will extract the initials:\n- First name: Olof\n- Last name: Sk\u00f6tkonung\n\nNow, we take the first letter of each:\n- First letter of 'Olof' is 'O'\n- First letter of 'Sk\u00f6tkonung' is 'S'\n\nFinally, we concatenate these initials and convert them to lowercase:\n- Concatenated initials: 'os'\n\nThis result provides the initials needed for the next step in answering the overall question.",
