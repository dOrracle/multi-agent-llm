Do you know the standard time zone for this area in winter and how to convert that to UTC? Additionally, consider if there are any daylight saving time changes that might affect the time difference. Can you elaborate on what time zone Montebello, New York, falls under and how to calculate the hours between that time zone and UTC?",

                "explanation": "Montebello, New York, is located in Rockland County, which operates on Eastern Standard Time (EST) during the winter months. EST is UTC-5, meaning it is 5 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Therefore, during winter, there is a 5-hour difference between the time in Montebello (EST) and UTC. Since the question specifically asks about the winter time zone, daylight saving time, which would change the time difference to UTC-4 (Eastern Daylight Time), does not apply. Thus, the final answer is that there are 5 hours between the winter time zone of Rockland County and UTC.",
