        "explanation": "To determine the number of repeated letters in the first name of Diya al-Dawla's paternal grandfather, we first identify the grandfather's name, which is 'Adud al-Dawla.' We focus on the first name 'Adud.' Next, we analyze the frequency of each letter in 'Adud':\n- A: 1 occurrence\n- d: 2 occurrences\n- u: 1 occurrence\n\nThe letter 'd' appears more than once, specifically twice. Therefore, we conclude that there is 1 letter ('d') that is repeated in the first name 'Adud.' This analysis leads us to the conclusion that the number of repeated letters in the first name of Diya al-Dawla's paternal grandfather is 1.",
