The gardens serve as a connector between Stanley Park and Blackpool Zoo, enhancing the recreational experience for visitors.\n\n5. **Historical Context**: Both parks were developed in the early to mid-20th century, with Stanley Park's design by Mawson in the 1920s and the establishment of Salisbury Woodland Gardens shortly thereafter in 1924.
