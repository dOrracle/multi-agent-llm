To answer the question about how many consonants are in the first name of the person who Billy Howle will work with in the film, we need to identify who that person is. From the information provided, it seems that he will star opposite Saoirse Ronan. Therefore, we need to focus on her first name, 'Saoirse'. After identifying her name, count the consonants in 'Saoirse'. Can you find the consonants in 'Saoirse' and then count them?",
