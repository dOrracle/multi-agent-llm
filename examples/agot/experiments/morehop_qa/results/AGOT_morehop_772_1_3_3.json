        "explanation": "The American Radio Relay League (ARRL) was founded on April 6, 1914. To calculate the difference between this founding year and the year 2024, we perform the following calculation: 2024 - 1914 = 110 years. This means that as of 2024, the ARRL will have been in existence for 110 years. This information is important as it highlights the longevity of the organization and its historical significance in the amateur radio community. The founding year is verified through multiple reliable sources, confirming its accuracy and relevance for the calculation.",

            "answer": "To consolidate the findings regarding the founding year of the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) and its significance for calculations, the following points summarize the previous tasks:\n\n1. **Founding Year Confirmation**: The ARRL was co-founded on April 6, 1914, by Hiram Percy Maxim and Clarence D. Tuska. This date is verified through multiple reliable sources, including the ARRL's official publications and historical records, confirming the accuracy of the founding year.\n\n2. **Significance of the Founding Year**: The founding year is crucial as it establishes the timeline for the ARRL's activities and its role within the amateur radio community. This timeline is essential for any calculations related to the age of the organization or its historical context in relation to other events or years.\n\n3. **Calculation of Year Difference**: The difference between the year 2024 and the founding year (1914) has been calculated as follows:\n   - Difference = 2024 - 1914 = 110 years. \n   This calculation provides a clear numerical answer to how long the ARRL has been established by the year 2024.\n\n4. **Final Verification**: The verification of the founding year through reliable sources ensures that the calculations are based on accurate data, which is critical for any further analysis or inquiries related to the ARRL.\n\nIn summary, the ARRL was founded in 1914, and as of 2024, it has been in existence for 110 years. This information serves as a reliable basis for any further discussions or calculations regarding the organization.",
