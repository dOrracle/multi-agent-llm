        "explanation": "To answer the question about the binary code of the last letter of the last name of the producer of 'The Lion King', we first need to confirm the producer's identity. The producer of 'The Lion King' is Don Hahn. His last name is 'Hahn'. The last letter of 'Hahn' is 'n'. Next, we convert this letter into its binary code representation. The ASCII value of 'n' is 110. The binary representation of 110 is 01101110. Therefore, the binary code of the last letter of the producer's last name is 01101110.",
