From the information provided, Fiachnae mac \u00c1edo R\u00f3in is Eochaid's father, and \u00c1ed R\u00f3in is his paternal grandfather. Next, we need to find the first letter of the name '\u00c1ed', convert it to lowercase, and then determine its ASCII code. Let\u2019s break it down step by step. First, confirm that you've identified \u00c1ed R\u00f3in as the correct ancestor. Then focus on the first letter you need to analyze: 'a' from \u00c1ed. What is the ASCII code for 'a'?",
