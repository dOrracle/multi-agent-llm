Since his last name is Boleyn, concentrate on the last letter of this name. Once you have determined the last letter, you can convert it into binary code. Remember that in binary, letters are typically represented using ASCII or Unicode values. Let's start by identifying the last letter of 'Boleyn'. What is that letter?",
