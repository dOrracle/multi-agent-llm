Since his mother is Ingegerd Olofsdotter, the maternal grandfather is King Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung of Sweden. Next, we need to ascertain the number of letters in both 'Malone' and 'Olof'. Consider calculating the length of these names and finding the difference to answer the question. Can you outline how you would do this step-by-step?",
