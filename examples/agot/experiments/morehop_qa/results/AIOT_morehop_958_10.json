In the information provided, we know that Diya al-Dawla is the son of 'Adud al-Dawla, leading us to identify that 'Adud al-Dawla is Diya al-Dawla's father. Next, we should find out who 'Adud al-Dawla's father is, to determine Diya al-Dawla's paternal grandfather. According to the data given, 'Adud al-Dawla's father is Rukn al-Dawla. Now, we need to focus on the name 'Rukn al-Dawla' and determine the first name of the paternal grandfather, which is 'Rukn'. Finally, we should count the repeated letters in 'Rukn'.
