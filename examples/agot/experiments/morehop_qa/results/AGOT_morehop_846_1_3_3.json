        "explanation": "To determine the day of the week for Olle Nordemar's date of birth, we first confirm his birth date. Olle Nordemar was born on **August 1, 1920**. To find the corresponding day of the week, we can use Zeller's Congruence, a well-known algorithm for calculating the day of the week for any date. The formula is as follows:\n\n1. Assign values: Day (q) = 1, Month (m) = 8 (August), Year = 1920 (K = 20, J = 19).\n2. Apply Zeller's formula:\n   \\[ h = (q + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{13(m + 1)}{5} \\right\\rfloor + K + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{K}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{J}{4} \\right\\rfloor - 2J) \\mod 7 \\]\n3.

Interpret the result: In Zeller's Congruence, 0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday. Therefore, \\( h = 1 \\) corresponds to **Sunday**.\n\nThus, Olle Nordemar was born on **August 1, 1920**, which was a **Sunday**.",
