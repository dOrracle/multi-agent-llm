We need to find the ASCII code of the first letter of the first name of the father of Francis Leclerc, the director of 'A No-Hit No-Run Summer'. We know from the context that Francis Leclerc's father is F\u00e9lix Leclerc. The first letter of F\u00e9lix is 'F'. Now, proceed to find the lowercase ASCII code for 'f'. Remember, ASCII codes range from 0 to 127, and you can look up the specific value for 'f' in lowercase. Can you do that?",
