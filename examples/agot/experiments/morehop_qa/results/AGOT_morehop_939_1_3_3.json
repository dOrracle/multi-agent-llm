            "answer": "To calculate the combined length of the first name and last name of William Paulet, 4th Marquess of Winchester's paternal grandmother, we first need to identify her name from the provided context.\n\nFrom the context, we know that William Paulet, 4th Marquess of Winchester is the son of William Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester and Anne or Agnes Howard. Thus, we need to find the name of William Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester's mother, who is the paternal grandmother of William Paulet, 4th Marquess of Winchester.\n\nThe text states that William Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester's mother is Elizabeth Willoughby (the first wife of John Paulet, 2nd Marquess of Winchester). Therefore, Elizabeth Willoughby is the identified grandmother.\n\nNext, we will calculate the combined length of her first name and last name:\n- First name: Elizabeth\n- Last name: Willoughby\n\nNow we count the characters in each name:\n- Length of 'Elizabeth': 9 characters\n- Length of 'Willoughby': 10 characters\n\nNow, we add these lengths together:\nCombined length = Length of 'Elizabeth' + Length of 'Willoughby' = 9 + 10 = 19 characters.\n\nThus, the combined length of the first name and last name of William Paulet, 4th Marquess of Winchester's paternal grandmother is 19 characters.",
