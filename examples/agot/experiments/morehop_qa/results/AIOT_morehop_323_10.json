Ramakrishna Rao, who directed 'Manamagan Thevai.' You've already established that he was married to Bhanumathi Ramakrishna. The key step here is to extract her last name, which is 'Ramakrishna.' Now, take the letters in this last name and arrange them in alphabetical order. What do you get when you do that?",
