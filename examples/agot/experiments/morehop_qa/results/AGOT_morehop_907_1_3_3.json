        "explanation": "To synthesize the findings regarding the last name of Ove Aunli's father-in-law, we first confirm that his father-in-law is Kristen Kvello, whose last name is 'Kvello'. Next, we analyze the last name 'Kvello' to determine the number of letters between its first and last letters. The first letter is 'K' and the last letter is 'o'. The letters that fall between 'K' and 'o' in the alphabet are 'L', 'M', and 'N'. Therefore, there are 3 letters between the first and last letters of the last name 'Kvello'.
