            "brain_thought": "Let's first ensure that we understand the critical components of your query: you need to determine the submission deadline in relation to the death date of James V. Kern, the director of 'April Showers'. From the details provided, Kern died on November 9, 1966. Given that the submission deadline is set for October 19, 2020, we should explore the time zone and how it relates to the date of Kern's passing. Since the deadline is expressed in AoE (Anywhere on Earth), let's consider how this affects our understanding of the date and time and whether any conversions are necessary. Now, can we summarize Kern's date of death and the deadline clearly? Can you calculate the difference in time between these two dates?",

                "explanation": "To determine the submission deadline in the context of the passing date of James V. Kern, we need to recognize that he passed away on November 9, 1966. The provided submission deadline is October 19, 2020, 19:37 AoE (Anywhere on Earth). This means the time is effectively the same regardless of the timezone; however, 'AoE' refers to the last time zone on earth (UTC-12). \n\nSince November 9, 1966, predates October 19, 2020, we should interpret the query to mean what the date and time are in Kern's time zone (likely PST/PDT considering he died in Encino, California). Kern's time zone would take into account the approximate UTC offset of -8 hours (standard time) during November, and -7 hours if it were Daylight Saving Time (which wouldn\u2019t apply here, as November 9 is outside of the DST range). Therefore, his death took place on November 9, 1966, at 12:00 AM PST.\n\nComparatively, the AOED deadline is at the end of the day 19 October 2020, suggesting that the deadline falls well over 53 years after Kern's passing.",
