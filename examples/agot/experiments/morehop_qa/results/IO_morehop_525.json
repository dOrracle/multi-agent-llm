    "explanation": "Princess Feodora of Denmark's father, Prince Harald of Denmark, was born on October 8, 1876. To find the number of days between October 8, 1876, and August 12, 1976, we calculate the total number of days between these two dates. The time span from October 8, 1876 to October 8, 1976 is exactly 100 years or 36525 days (including leap years). The additional days from October 8, 1976 to August 12, 1976 would need to be subtracted as they are before the target date. Thus, from October 8, 1976, back to August 12, 1976 is 57 days young, leading to a total of 36525 - 57 = 36468 days.",
    "answer": "36468"
