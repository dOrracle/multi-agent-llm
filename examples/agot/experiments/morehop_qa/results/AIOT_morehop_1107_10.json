We're looking to convert this date and time into the local time zone of Rockland County, New York, where Erik Hort was born. First, identify the time difference between AoE and New York during February 1984. Then, calculate if Daylight Saving Time affects this and determine the correct local time for the deadline in Montebello, New York. Can you verify the current standard time zone for New York in February and how it relates to AoE?",

                "explanation": "To convert the deadline of 17 February 1984, 15:35 AoE to local time in Montebello, New York, we first note that AoE (Anywhere on Earth) signifies the last moment of that date anywhere in the world. In 1984, New York operated under Eastern Standard Time (EST), which is UTC-5. The conversion involves checking if New York was observing Daylight Saving Time at that point, which it was not, as it starts in March. Consequently, we deduct the 5 hours from the AoE time. Specifically, the last moment of 17 February 1984 AoE (15:35) is equivalent to 17:35 on 17 February 1984 UTC. Subtracting 5 hours for EST gives us 12:35 on 17 February 1984 in Montebello, New York. Therefore, the deadline is 12:35 PM on 17 February 1984 in Montebello, New York.",
