        "explanation": "To synthesize the findings related to Sigma Xi and American Scientist, we first note that Sigma Xi was founded in 1886. The magazine American Scientist has been published since 1913, which is 27 years after Sigma Xi's establishment. The task requires us to find the difference between the founding year of Sigma Xi (1886) and the year 2024. By performing the calculation: 2024 - 1886, we find that the difference is 138 years. This means that as of 2024, it will have been 138 years since Sigma Xi was founded. This information is crucial as it highlights the longevity and historical significance of Sigma Xi in relation to the magazine, which serves as a platform for scientific communication and education.",

            "answer": "To calculate the difference between the year 2024 and the founding year of Sigma Xi (1886), we perform the following calculation:\n\n1. Identify the years involved:\n   - Year of interest: 2024\n   - Founding year of Sigma Xi: 1886\n\n2. Calculate the difference:\n   - Difference = Year of interest - Founding year\n   - Difference = 2024 - 1886\n   - Difference = 138\n\nThus, the difference between the year 2024 and the founding year of Sigma Xi (1886) is 138 years. This indicates that 138 years have passed since Sigma Xi was established.",
