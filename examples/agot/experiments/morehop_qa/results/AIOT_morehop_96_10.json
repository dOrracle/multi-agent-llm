The question asks for the number of distinct two-letter combinations in the first name of the screenwriter who co-wrote a film starring Nicolas Cage and T\u00e9a Leoni. From the information provided, we know the screenwriter is David Weissman, who co-wrote \"The Family Man\". Now focus on the first name 'David'.
