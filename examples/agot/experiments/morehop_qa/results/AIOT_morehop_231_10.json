From the information provided, we know that Prince Harald was born on 8 October 1876. Next, we'll need to add together all the digits from this date: the day (8), the month (10), and the year (1876). Go ahead and extract those numbers and calculate the sum of their digits. Remember, you should sum them like this: 8 (from the day) + 1 + 0 (from the month) + 1 + 8 + 7 + 6 (from the year). After that, let's add those results. Can you walk through that calculation step by step?",

Sum the digits:\n   - For the day: 8\n   - For the month: 1 + 0 = 1\n   - For the year: 1 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 22\n\n4. Combine these sums: 8 (day) + 1 (month) + 22 (year) = 31.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all the digits in the day, month, and year of when Princess Feodora of Denmark's father was born is 31.",
