        "explanation": "To consolidate the findings regarding the last names of Merle Beil and Asta Nielsen, we first confirm the last names: Merle Beil's last name is **Beil** and Asta Nielsen's last name is **Nielsen**. Next, we calculate the lengths of these last names: the length of **Beil** is 4 letters, while the length of **Nielsen** is 7 letters. To find the difference in their lengths, we subtract the length of Beil from the length of Nielsen: 7 (Nielsen) - 4 (Beil) = 3. Therefore, Merle Beil's last name has 3 fewer letters than Asta Nielsen's last name.",
