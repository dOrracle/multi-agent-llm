                    "answer": "Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg, experienced significant changes in her public image and royal duties following her marriage to and subsequent divorce from Prince Joachim of Denmark. Initially, her marriage in 1995 positioned her as a key figure within the Danish royal family, enhancing her public profile and allowing her to engage in various royal duties and charitable activities. Her mixed Chinese-European heritage also brought a unique perspective to the royal family, contributing to a more diverse representation.\n\nHowever, the dissolution of her marriage in 2005 had a profound impact on her public image. The divorce was highly publicized, leading to a shift in how she was perceived by the public and the media. While she maintained her title as Countess of Frederiksborg, her role within the royal family diminished, and she was no longer seen as a central royal figure. This change often resulted in a more complex public narrative, where she was sometimes viewed through the lens of her marital status rather than her individual contributions.\n\nPost-divorce, Alexandra continued to participate in royal duties but faced challenges in redefining her public persona. She focused on her charitable work, particularly in areas related to health and social issues, which helped to gradually rebuild her image as a dedicated public servant. Nevertheless, the shadow of her divorce lingered, influencing public perception and the nature of her engagements within the royal context.\n\nIn summary, Alexandra's marriage and divorce significantly affected her public image, transitioning her from a prominent royal figure to a more independent, yet sometimes scrutinized, public personality. Her royal duties continued, but the nature and perception of her role evolved in response to her changed marital status.",
