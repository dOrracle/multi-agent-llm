Dui Finn is reported to be the son of S\u00e9tna Innarraid. Thus, S\u00e9tna Innarraid is Dui Finn's father, and to find the grandfather, we seek S\u00e9tna Innarraid's kingly father. The sources provided, while rich in detail about S\u00e9tna Innarraid and Dui Finn, do not explicitly name S\u00e9tna Innarraid's father, leaving a gap in the lineage.

Notably, there is frequent mention of figures such as Bres R\u00ed, but he is named as S\u00e9tna Innarraid's father, which complicates the effort to determine the grandfather's name. Therefore, without additional context or historical texts indicating S\u00e9tna Innarraid's father, I cannot accurately derive a name or a first letter representing the last name of Dui Finn's paternal grandfather.
