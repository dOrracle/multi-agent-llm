            "brain_thought": "To solve this problem, we need to focus on several key aspects. First, let's clarify the time zone for Hastings, Nebraska, since the deadline is given in Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time. Do you know what time zone Hastings is in and if there are any significant local laws or practices regarding daylight saving time that might affect the time conversion? After identifying the correct time zone, we can calculate the corresponding local time for the deadline given in AoE. Make sure to think through the time differences and conversion accurately.",

                "explanation": "Hastings, Nebraska, is located in the Central Time Zone (CT). However, we must also determine if Daylight Saving Time (DST) might be relevant for the date in question. In 1985, Daylight Saving Time was practiced in Nebraska, typically starting on the first Sunday in April and ending on the last Sunday in October. As the deadline is set for April 27, 1985, Daylight Saving Time would have been in effect. This means that the local time in Hastings, Nebraska, would be Central Daylight Time (CDT), which is UTC-5. The AoE time of 27 April 1985, 13:05 would be UTC-12. To convert the AoE time to Hastings\u2019 local time, we need to calculate the difference between UTC-12 and UTC-5:\n\n1. Convert 13:05 (AoE) to UTC: \n   - 13:05 AoE + 12 hours = 01:05 (next day, April 28, 1985) UTC.\n2. Convert the UTC time to Hastings\u2019 local time (CDT): \n   - 01:05 UTC - 5 hours = 20:05 (April 27, 1985) CDT.\nTherefore, the final answer is that the submission deadline in Hastings, Nebraska, is on April 27, 1985, at 8:05 PM.",
