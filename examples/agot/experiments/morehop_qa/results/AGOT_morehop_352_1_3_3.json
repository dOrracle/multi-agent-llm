His elevation to the peerage in 1743 and membership in the Privy Council of Ireland in 1746 indicate a high social standing and influence in political circles.\n\n2. **Family Connections**: The Wingfield family had notable connections through marriage and lineage. Richard Wingfield's mother, Eleanor Gore, was the daughter of Sir Arthur Gore, 1st Baronet, which ties the family to other influential families of the time. This connection likely enhanced their social standing.\n\n3. **Social Engagement**: The commissioning of extensive remodelling work on Powerscourt House by the German architect Richard Cassels between 1731 and 1741 suggests that the Wingfields were not only wealthy but also engaged in social and cultural activities, which were important for maintaining and enhancing their social status.\n\n4. **Subsequent Generations**: Edward Wingfield, 2nd Viscount Powerscourt, continued the family legacy, serving in the British House of Commons while holding an Irish peerage.
