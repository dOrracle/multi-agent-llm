    "explanation": "The first name of Diya al-Dawla's paternal grandfather is Rukn al-Dawla. In the name 'Rukn', the letter 'R' has no repetition, the letter 'u' has no repetition, the letter 'k' has no repetition, and the letter 'n' has no repetition. In the name 'al-Dawla', the letter 'a' appears twice, the letter 'l' appears twice, and the letter 'D' has no repetition, the letter 'w' has no repetition. Overall, we find one repeated letter ('a' and 'l'). Therefore, there are a total of 3 repeated letters: a (appearing twice in al-Dawla), and l (appearing twice in al-Dawla). The total number of unique repeated letters is 2: {'a', 'l'}.",
