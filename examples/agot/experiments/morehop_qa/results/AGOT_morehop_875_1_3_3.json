                    "answer": "To trace the family tree of the Russell family leading to John Russell, 3rd Baron Ampthill, we start with the information provided:\n\n1. **John Russell, 3rd Baron Ampthill** (1896-1973) was the son of **Oliver Russell, 2nd Baron Ampthill**. This establishes the direct lineage from Oliver to John.\n\n2. **Geoffrey Russell, 4th Baron Ampthill** (1921-2011) is the son of John Russell, 3rd Baron Ampthill. This confirms that Geoffrey is directly descended from John.\n\n3. To find Geoffrey's paternal grandfather, we need to identify the father of John Russell, which we have established as Oliver Russell, 2nd Baron Ampthill.\n\n4. Thus, the lineage progression is as follows:\n   - **Oliver Russell, 2nd Baron Ampthill** (paternal grandfather of Geoffrey)\n   - **John Russell, 3rd Baron Ampthill** (father of Geoffrey)\n   - **Geoffrey Russell, 4th Baron Ampthill**\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that the last name of Geoffrey Russell's paternal grandfather is **Russell**.

                    "answer": "To analyze the Ampthill Baby Case regarding Geoffrey Russell's legitimacy, we need to focus on the implications of the legal proceedings on his family lineage. The case centers around the petition made by John Russell, 3rd Baron Ampthill, who sought to disclaim paternity while divorcing Geoffrey's mother, Christabel Hulme Hart, in 1923. This petition was based on claims of non-consummation of the marriage.\n\n1. **Legal Proceedings**: The initial petition was rejected on appeal, which resulted in a declaration that Geoffrey was legitimate. This legal ruling is critical as it establishes Geoffrey's right to inherit the title and the implications for the family lineage.\n\n2. **Impact on Succession**: The legitimacy ruling allowed Geoffrey to succeed to the title of Baron Ampthill upon his father's death in 1973, despite challenges from his half-brother. The Committee for Privileges ruled in favor of Geoffrey in 1976, affirming his position within the family lineage.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: Understanding the societal norms and legal frameworks of the time is essential. The case reflects the complexities of aristocratic lineage and the importance of legitimacy in inheritance rights.\n\n4. **Family Dynamics**: The case also sheds light on the relationships within the Russell family, particularly between Geoffrey and his half-brother, which were strained due to the legitimacy dispute.\n\nIn summary, the Ampthill Baby Case is pivotal in understanding Geoffrey Russell's legitimacy and the implications it had on the family lineage, particularly regarding inheritance and succession to the title of Baron Ampthill.",
