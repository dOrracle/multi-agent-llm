            "answer": "To verify the historical context of the Bay of Pigs Invasion and its significance in relation to Francisco Jose Hernandez, we start by confirming the details surrounding the invasion itself. \n\n1. **Historical Context of the Bay of Pigs Invasion**: The Bay of Pigs Invasion occurred on April 17, 1961. This military operation was executed by Brigade 2506, a group of Cuban exiles who were trained and funded by the CIA. The primary objective was to overthrow Fidel Castro's government, which had taken a communist direction after the Cuban Revolution.\n\n2. **Significance of the Year**: The year 1961 is significant as it marks a pivotal moment in U.S.-Cuba relations, showcasing the lengths to which the U.S. government would go to combat the spread of communism in Latin America. The invasion ultimately failed, leading to a consolidation of Castro's power and increased tensions between the U.S. and Cuba.\n\n3. **Connection to Francisco Jose Hernandez**: Francisco Jose Hernandez, also known as \"Pepe\", is noted as a Cuban exile and participant in the Bay of Pigs Invasion. His involvement places him within the context of the anti-Castro movement that emerged during this period. Hernandez later became a co-founder and president of the Cuban American National Foundation, indicating his continued engagement in Cuban affairs and opposition to the Castro regime.\n\n4. **Concatenation of the Second and Third Digits of the Year**: The year of the Bay of Pigs Invasion is 1961. The second digit is '9' and the third digit is '6'. Concatenating these two digits results in '96'.\n\nIn conclusion, the Bay of Pigs Invasion is historically significant due to its implications for U.S. foreign policy and its impact on Cuban exiles like Francisco Jose Hernandez. The verification of the year (1961) and its digits (9 and 6) supports the context needed for the subsequent question.",
