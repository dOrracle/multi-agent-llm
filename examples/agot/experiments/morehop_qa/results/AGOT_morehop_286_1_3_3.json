        "explanation": "To determine the number of distinct two-letter combinations from the first name 'Thomas', we first identify the distinct letters in the name. The letters in 'Thomas' are T, h, o, m, a, and s, which gives us a total of 6 unique letters. We then apply the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the number of distinct letters (6) and k is the number of letters to choose (2). Calculating this, we find C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * 4!) = (6 * 5) / (2 * 1) = 15. Therefore, the total number of distinct two-letter combinations that can be formed from the letters in 'Thomas' is 15. This result answers the question regarding the number of distinct two-letter combinations from the first name of Joseph-Andr\u00e9 Taschereau's paternal grandfather.",
