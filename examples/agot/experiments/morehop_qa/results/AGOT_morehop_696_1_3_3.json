        "explanation": "To calculate the sum of all the digits in the date of death of M. B. Sreenivasan, we first break down the date, which is 9 March 1988, into its components: the day, month, and year. The components are as follows: \n- Day: 9 \n- Month: 3 \n- Year: 1988, which consists of the digits 1, 9, 8, and 8. \n\nNext, we sum these individual digits: \n- Sum = Day (9) + Month (3) + Year Digits (1 + 9 + 8 + 8) \n- This results in the calculation: 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 8 + 8. \n\nNow, performing the arithmetic: \n- 9 + 3 = 12 \n- 1 + 9 = 10 \n- 10 + 8 = 18 \n- 18 + 8 = 26 \n- Finally, 12 + 18 = 30. \n\nThus, the total sum of the digits from the date of death is 30.",
