The film is 'Maniac', directed by Shia LaBeouf, whose birthdate is June 11, 1986. From there, calculate the date 3 months after that birthdate. Make sure you're applying the correct method to add three months to a date, considering how months vary in length and the transition to the next year if needed.",

                "explanation": "Shia LaBeouf, director of 'Maniac', was born on June 11, 1986. To find the date that is three months after this date, start counting from June 11, 1986. Adding three months leads us through July, August, and into September. Therefore, three months after June 11 is September 11, 1986. This calculation considers that each of the added months (July and August) has 31 and 30 days respectively, thus no complications arise from month lengths in this specific case. Therefore, the final calculated date is September 11, 1986.",
