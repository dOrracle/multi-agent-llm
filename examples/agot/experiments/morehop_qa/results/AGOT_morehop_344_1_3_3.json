        "explanation": "To consolidate the findings regarding the unique letters in the last name of Abaqa Khan's paternal grandmother, we begin by confirming her last name, which is 'Yes\u00fcn\u010din'. We will analyze this name to identify the unique letters it contains. The breakdown of the letters in 'Yes\u00fcn\u010din' is as follows: Y, e, s, \u00fc, n, \u00e7, i, n. Upon reviewing these letters, we note that 'n' appears twice, but for the purpose of counting unique letters, we only consider it once. Therefore, the unique letters are: Y, e, s, \u00fc, n, \u00e7, i. Counting these gives us a total of 7 unique letters. Thus, the final answer regarding the number of unique letters in the last name of Abaqa Khan's paternal grandmother is 7.",
