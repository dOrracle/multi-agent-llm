The query is asking for the number of letters between the first and last letters of the first name of this individual. Start by recalling that John Farrow was married to actress Maureen O'Sullivan, so we should look at her first name, Maureen. From there, determine how many letters are between the first letter 'M' and the last letter 'n'. This will require calculating the length and finding the letters in between, considering clear identification and accurate counting. Have you identified the name and are you ready to proceed with the counting?",

To find the number of letters between 'M' (first letter) and 'n' (last letter), we need to look at the letters in between: 'a', 'u', 'r', 'e', 'e'.
