            "brain_thought": "Let's start by breaking down the query. The question is asking for the difference in years between when QST was first published and the year 2024. From the information available, we know that QST's first issue was dated December 1915. Now, think about how you can calculate the difference between 1915 and 2024. Can you work through that calculation step by step?",

                "explanation": "To find the difference between the year QST was first published (December 1915) and the year 2024, we first identify the starting year for the calculation, which is 1915. We then perform the subtraction: 2024 - 1915 = 109 years. Therefore, the difference in years between the foundation year of QST and 2024 is 109 years.",
