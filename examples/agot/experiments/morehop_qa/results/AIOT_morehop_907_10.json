We need to determine the last name of Ove Aunli's father-in-law, which is \"Kvello.\" Now, consider how to find the number of letters between the first and last letters of the last name \"Kvello.\" What are the first and last letters of \"Kvello,\" and how many letters are between them?",

                "explanation": "To find the number of letters between the first and last letters of the last name of Ove Aunli's father-in-law, we first need to identify the last name. Ove Aunli is married to Berit Aunli, whose father's name is Kristen Kvello. Therefore, the last name of Ove Aunli's father-in-law is 'Kvello'. The first letter of 'Kvello' is 'K', and the last letter is 'o'. To calculate the number of letters between 'K' and 'o', we count the letters within the substring from 'K' to 'o'. The letters in 'Kvello' are: 'K', 'v', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'. The letters between 'K' (the 1st letter) and 'o' (the 6th letter) are 'v', 'e', 'l', 'l', which are 4 letters total.
