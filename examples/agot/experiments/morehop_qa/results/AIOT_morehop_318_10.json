                "explanation": "Pirjo Honkasalo's spouse is Pirkko Saisio. The last name is 'Saisio', which has 6 letters. Alexandra's first name 'Alexandra' has 9 letters. To find how many additional letters Alexandra's first name has compared to Saisio's last name, we subtract the length of Saisio from the length of Alexandra: 9 (Alexandra) - 6 (Saisio) = 3.
