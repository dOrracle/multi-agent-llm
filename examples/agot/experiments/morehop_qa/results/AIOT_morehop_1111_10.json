            "brain_thought": "To answer the question, you need to determine the date and time of the submission deadline in the timezone of Scranton, Pennsylvania, where Tom Flannery was born. Let's start by identifying the date and time of the deadline provided in the query, which is January 9, 2029, at 03:58 AoE. Next, we need to convert this time from AoE to the local time of Scranton. Remember that AoE is the last time zone on Earth, meaning it is UTC-12:00. Scranton operates on Eastern Standard Time (EST), which is UTC-5:00, and it follows Daylight Saving Time (EDT) in the summer months. Since January is winter, we will use EST for our calculations. Can you figure out the time difference between these two time zones and calculate the local time in Scranton?",
