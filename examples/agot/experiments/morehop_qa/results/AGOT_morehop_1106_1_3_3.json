        "explanation": "To consolidate the findings regarding the time difference between Rockland County, New York, and UTC during the winter months, we summarize the following points: 1. **Winter Time Zone**: Rockland County, including Montebello, observes Eastern Standard Time (EST) during the winter months, which typically lasts from the first Sunday in November until the second Sunday in March. 2. **UTC Offset**: The UTC offset for Eastern Standard Time (EST) is -5 hours. This indicates that during the winter months, the local time in Rockland County is 5 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). 3. **Final Calculation**: Therefore, the time difference between Rockland County during the winter months and UTC is 5 hours. This conclusion confirms that the local time in Rockland County is consistently 5 hours behind UTC during the winter period.",

Rockland County is located in the Eastern Time Zone (ET) of the United States.\n\n1. **Time Zone Identification**: Rockland County, New York, observes Eastern Standard Time (EST) during the winter months. This is typically from the first Sunday in November until the second Sunday in March.\n\n2. **UTC Offset**: Eastern Standard Time (EST) has a UTC offset of -5 hours. This means that during the winter, Rockland County is 5 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The UTC offset for Rockland County during winter is -5 hours.
