Ingegerd's father is King Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung of Sweden. Therefore, we need to focus on the name 'Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung'. From this, you can extract the first letter of the first name 'Olof' (which is 'o') and the first letter of the last name 'Sk\u00f6tkonung' (which is 's'). What do you think the next step is?",
