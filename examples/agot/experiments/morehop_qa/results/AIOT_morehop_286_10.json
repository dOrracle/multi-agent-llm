It's crucial to focus solely on the first name, which is 'Thomas'.  Now, consider the letters in 'Thomas'. What distinct two-letter combinations can you derive from it? Start by listing the letters in 'Thomas' and then think of ways to pair them.",

                "explanation": "To determine the number of distinct two-letter combinations that can be formed from the first name \"Thomas,\" we first analyze the letters in the name. The unique letters in \"Thomas\" are: T, H, O, M, A, S. This gives us the set {T, H, O, M, A, S} which consists of 6 distinct letters. \n\nWe will create combinations by selecting 2 letters at a time. The number of ways to choose 2 letters from 6 can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of letters and k is the number of letters chosen. \n\nApplying this to our case:\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 6! / (2! * 4!) = (6 \u00d7 5) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 15. \n\nThus, the distinct two-letter combinations from the letters in \"Thomas\" are: TH, TO, TM, TA, TS, HO, HM, HA, HS, OM, OA, OS, MA, MS, AS. The calculation confirms there are 15 distinct two-letter combinations.",
