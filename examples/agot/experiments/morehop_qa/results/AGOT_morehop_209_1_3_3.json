The key points from the research conducted on notable Cholmondeley family members, the last names of wives, and the analysis of historical records are as follows:\n\n1. **Hugh Cholmondeley, 1st Earl of Cholmondeley**: He was the son of Robert Cholmondeley, 1st Viscount Cholmondeley, and Elizabeth Cradock. Notably, he never married, which means there are no maternal last names to consider from his direct lineage.\n\n2. **Robert Cholmondeley, 1st Viscount Cholmondeley**: His mother was Mary Bodvile, establishing that the last name of Hugh Cholmondeley's paternal grandmother is indeed Bodvile. This was confirmed through the analysis of historical records, which traced Robert Cholmondeley's lineage back to his parents, Hugh Cholmondeley and Mary Bodvile.\n\n3. **Last Names of Wives**: The only wife identified in the lineage is Elizabeth Cradock, the wife of Robert Cholmondeley, which contributes to understanding the family connections but does not directly answer the question about the paternal grandmother.\n\nIn conclusion, the consolidated findings clearly indicate that the last name of Hugh Cholmondeley's paternal grandmother is Bodvile, based on the lineage traced through Robert Cholmondeley, 1st Viscount Cholmondeley, and his mother Mary Bodvile.",
