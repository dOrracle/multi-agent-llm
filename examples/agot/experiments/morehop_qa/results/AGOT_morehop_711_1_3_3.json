            "answer": "To calculate the date that is 10 months prior to the death date of Ren\u00e9 Clair, we first need to identify his date of death. According to the provided context, Ren\u00e9 Clair died on 15 March 1981.\n\nNext, we will subtract 10 months from this date. \n\n1. **Starting Date**: 15 March 1981\n2. **Subtracting 10 Months**: \n   - From March, we count back 10 months:\n     - March (1) -> February (2) -> January (3) -> December (4) -> November (5) -> October (6) -> September (7) -> August (8) -> July (9) -> June (10)\n   - This brings us to June.\n\n3. **Final Day Calculation**: Since we are subtracting months and not days, the day remains the same as the original date (15th), unless the resulting month has fewer days. June has 30 days, so the 15th is valid.\n\nThus, 10 months before 15 March 1981 is 15 June 1980.\n\nThis calculation provides the necessary date that contributes to answering the overall question.",
