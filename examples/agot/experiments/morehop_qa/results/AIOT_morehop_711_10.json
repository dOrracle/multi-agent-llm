            "brain_thought": "To find the answer to the query, we must first identify the date of death of Ren\u00e9 Clair, the director of 'Break the News'. Ren\u00e9 Clair died on 15 March 1981. Next, we need to calculate the date that is 10 months before this date. A good starting point would be reviewing how to subtract months from a date, particularly understanding that 10 months back from March would take us into the previous year and adjust the day accordingly. Do you know how to perform that calculation?",

                "explanation": "To determine the date 10 months before the death of Ren\u00e9 Clair, we start with his date of death: 15 March 1981. To calculate 10 months earlier, we first consider the month. Moving back 10 months from March would take us back to May of the previous year (1980). Specifically, 10 months back from March (month 3) would lead us to May of the previous year because: \n\n- March to February (1 month back) = February \n- February to January (2 months back) = January \n- January to December (3 months back) = December \n- December to November (4 months back) = November \n- November to October (5 months back) = October \n- October to September (6 months back) = September \n- September to August (7 months back) = August \n- August to July (8 months back) = July \n- July to June (9 months back) = June \n- June to May (10 months back) = May \n\nThus, the date 10 months before 15 March 1981 is 15 May 1980.",
