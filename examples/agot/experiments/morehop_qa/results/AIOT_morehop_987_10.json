Nevinson and Dora Carrington. Bomberg painted a series of complex geometric compositions combining the influences of cubism and futurism in the years immediately preceding World War I; typically using a limited number of striking colours, turning humans into simple, angular shapes, and sometimes overlaying the whole painting a strong grid-work colouring scheme. He was expelled from the Slade School of Art in 1913, with agreement between the senior teachers Tonks, Frederick Brown and Philip Wilson Steer, because of the audacity of his breach from the conventional approach of that time.']], ['The Mud Bath', [\"The Mud Bath is a 1914 oil-on-canvas painting by David Bomberg. The work is considered a masterpiece of Bomberg's work in this period. Bomberg was a founder member of the London Group, and the painting is considered a leading example of Vorticism, although Bomberg resisted being described as a Vorticist.\"]]] ['How many consonants are there in the place where the painter of The Mud Bath studied?\\n Answer: ']",

The focus is on determining the number of consonants in the name of the institution where David Bomberg studied, which is the Slade School of Art. First, recall the name.\n\nOnce you have the name, think about how to count the consonants in 'Slade School of Art'. Remember to identify the consonants and count them accurately. First, can you state the name of the institution in full? Then, can you identify the consonants present in that name?",
