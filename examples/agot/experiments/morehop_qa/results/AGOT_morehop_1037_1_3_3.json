            "answer": "To execute the task of counting the occurrences of the letter 'n' in the last name of the paternal grandfather of Alice Clere, we first need to ensure we have the correct last name. Alice Clere is the daughter of Sir William Boleyn, whose paternal grandfather is Sir Geoffrey Boleyn. Therefore, the last name we need to analyze is 'Boleyn'. \n\nNext, we will count the occurrences of the letter 'n' in 'Boleyn'. The breakdown of the letters in 'Boleyn' is as follows:\n- B: 0 occurrences of 'n'\n- o: 0 occurrences of 'n'\n- l: 0 occurrences of 'n'\n- e: 0 occurrences of 'n'\n- y: 0 occurrences of 'n'\n- n: 1 occurrence of 'n'\n\nUpon counting, we find that the letter 'n' appears 1 time in the last name 'Boleyn'. \n\nThus, the detailed execution confirms that the letter 'n' appears 1 time in the last name of the paternal grandfather of Alice Clere.",
