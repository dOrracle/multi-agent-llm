This marked their 14th season in the NFL and they failed to qualify for the playoffs for the fourteenth consecutive year. The only victory they achieved was a narrow win against the New York Jets, which they won by a single point. Notable players from the Saints during that season included running back George Rogers, who was a standout player despite the team's overall struggles. Rogers was the first overall pick in the 1981 NFL Draft and went on to have a successful career, but during the 1980 season, he was one of the few bright spots for the Saints. The team's performance that year is often referenced in discussions about their historical struggles and the challenges they faced in building a competitive roster. Additionally, Adger Armstrong, a fullback for the Saints, played college football at Texas A&M University, establishing a direct connection between the team and this specific college.",
