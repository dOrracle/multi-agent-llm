            "answer": "To consolidate the political context surrounding the founding events and founders of the Indian National Congress (INC), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Janata Dal (Secular), we can summarize the following key points:\n\n### Indian National Congress (INC)\n- **Founded**: 1885\n- **Founders**: Key figures include A.O. Hume, Dadabhai Naoroji, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Mahatma Gandhi (who joined later and became a pivotal leader).\n- **Political Context**: The INC was established during a period of growing nationalist sentiment in India, responding to British colonial rule. It aimed to provide a platform for Indians to voice their concerns and aspirations for self-governance. The party became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement, particularly after 1920 under Gandhi's leadership.\n\n### Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)\n- **Founded**: 1980 (evolved from Bharatiya Jana Sangh, founded in 1951)\n- **Founders**: Syama Prasad Mukherjee is recognized as a founding figure of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, which later transformed into the BJP.\n- **Political Context**: The BJP emerged in the context of a growing Hindu nationalist sentiment in India, particularly in response to the perceived failures of the INC to address the needs of Hindu society. The party gained prominence during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which significantly shaped its political identity.\n\n### Janata Dal (Secular)\n- **Founded**: 1999\n- **Founders**: H. D. Deve Gowda is the prominent leader associated with the founding of Janata Dal (Secular), which was formed after a split from the Janata Dal party.\n- **Political Context**: The Janata Dal (Secular) was established in a regional context, primarily focusing on the political dynamics of Karnataka. It aimed to represent the interests of various social groups and has been influential in Karnataka politics.\n\n### Summary\nThe political context during the founding of these parties reflects a complex interplay of nationalist aspirations, regional identities, and the evolving political landscape in India. The INC was born out of a need for a unified voice against colonial rule, the BJP arose from a desire to assert Hindu identity and nationalism, and the Janata Dal (Secular) sought to address regional and social issues in Karnataka. This historical backdrop is crucial for understanding the motivations and challenges faced by the founders of these political parties.",
