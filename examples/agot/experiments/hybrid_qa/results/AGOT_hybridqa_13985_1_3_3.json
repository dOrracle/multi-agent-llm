        "explanation": "Franklin Pierce served as a senator from New Hampshire until his resignation on February 28, 1842. Following his resignation, Leonard Wilcox was appointed to fill the vacancy on March 1, 1842. During the 27th Congress, the two senators from New Hampshire were Franklin Pierce and Leonard Wilcox.

Therefore, Wilcox is considered the more senior senator by default, as he was the only senator representing New Hampshire after Pierce's departure.",

Franklin Pierce served as a senator from New Hampshire until his resignation in 1842. At the time of his resignation, Leonard Wilcox was appointed to fill the vacancy left by Pierce. Since Wilcox was the only senator from New Hampshire after Pierce's resignation, he holds the position of the more senior senator by default.
