Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms .

The V-1 was the first of the so-called Vengeance weapons series ( V-weapons or Vergeltungswaffen ) deployed for the terror bombing of London . It was developed at Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center in 1939 by the Nazi German Luftwaffe at the beginning of the Second World War , and during initial development was known by the codename Cherry Stone . Because of limited range , thousands of V-1 missiles launched into England were fired from launch facilities along the French ( Pas-de-Calais ) and Dutch coasts . The Wehrmacht first launched the V-1 to target London on 13 June 1944 , one week after ( and prompted by ) the successful Allied landings in Europe . At peak , more than one hundred V-1s a day were fired at south-east England , 9,521 in total , decreasing in number as sites were overrun until October 1944 , when the last V-1 site in range of Britain was overrun by Allied forces . After this , the Germans directed V-1s at the port of Antwerp and at other targets in Belgium , launching 2,448 V-1s . The attacks stopped only a month before the war in Europe ended , when the last launch site in the Low Countries was overrun on 29 March 1945 .

Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term stained glass to include domestic lead light and objects d'art created from foil glasswork exemplified in the famous lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany . As a material stained glass is glass that has been coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture . The coloured glass is crafted into stained glass windows in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures , held together ( traditionally ) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame . Painted details and yellow stain are often used to enhance the design . The term stained glass is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln . Stained glass , as an art and a craft , requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design , and the engineering skills to assemble the piece . A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made , must resist wind and rain , and also , especially in the larger windows , must support its own weight .

It doesnt include the power to take and transfer ownership of private property from one property owner to another private property owner without a valid public purpose . However , this power can be legislatively delegated by the state to municipalities , government subdivisions , or even to private persons or corporations , when they are authorized by the legislature to exercise the functions of public character . In the Anglo-American historical context , property taken could be used only by the government taking the property in question . The most common uses of property taken by eminent domain have been for roads , government buildings and public utilities . However , in the mid-20th century , a new application of eminent domain was pioneered , in which the government could take the property and transfer it to a private third party . This was initially done only to a property that has been deemed blighted or a development impediment , on the principle that such properties had a negative impact upon surrounding property owners , but was later expanded to allow the taking of any private property when the new third-party owner could develop the property in such a way as to bring in increased tax revenues to the government . Some jurisdictions require that the taker make an offer to purchase the subject property , before resorting to the use of eminent domain . However , once the property is taken and the judgment is final , the condemnor owns it in fee simple , and may put it to uses other than those specified in the eminent domain action .

The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century .

As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style .

Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .'}]}, {'value': 'Church of the Holy Apostles', 'urls': []}, {'value': 'Ore 50\u00b052\u203224\u2033N 0\u00b036\u203237\u2033E / 50.8732\u00b0N 0.6103\u00b0E / 50.8732 ; 0.6103 ( Former Church of the Holy Apostles , Ore )', 'urls': [{'url': '/wiki/Ore_Valley', 'summary': 'Ore , a former village , is still known locally as a village by local population , although it now a suburb of the urban area of the town and borough of Hastings in East Sussex , England .
