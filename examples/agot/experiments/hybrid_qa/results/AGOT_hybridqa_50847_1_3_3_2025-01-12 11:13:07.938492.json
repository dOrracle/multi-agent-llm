        "explanation": "To consolidate the findings regarding the West Coast Conference (WCC) team that had double-digit losses and is nicknamed the Pilots, we first identify the relevant data from the provided table. The Portland Pilots are confirmed to be the only team in the WCC with double-digit losses, specifically having an overall record of 20-11, which translates to 11 losses. This meets the criteria of having double-digit losses. Additionally, the nickname 'Pilots' is explicitly associated with the University of Portland, confirming their identity as the team in question. Therefore, the consolidation of findings clearly indicates that the Portland Pilots are the team with double-digit losses in the WCC.",
