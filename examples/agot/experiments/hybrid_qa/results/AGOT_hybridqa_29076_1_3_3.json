        "explanation": "To identify the younger American runner from the 2010 Chicago Marathon, we first need to consider the ages of the two American runners who participated: Jason Hartmann and Mike Sayenko. Based on their birth dates, we can calculate their ages at the time of the marathon, which took place on October 10, 2010. \n\n1. **Jason Hartmann** was born on March 23, 1981. By the date of the marathon in 2010, he would have been 29 years old. \n2. **Mike Sayenko** was born on July 12, 1984. By the date of the marathon in 2010, he would have been 26 years old. \n\nNow, comparing their ages: \n- Jason Hartmann: 29 years old \n- Mike Sayenko: 26 years old \n\nSince Mike Sayenko is younger than Jason Hartmann, the younger American runner at the 2010 Chicago Marathon is Mike Sayenko.",

The only American runner listed is Jason Hartmann, who was born on March 23, 1981. \n\nNext, we need to check the ages of the other runners mentioned in the data:\n1. Samuel Wanjiru (Kenya) - Born November 10, 1986\n2. Tsegaye Kebede (Ethiopia) - Born January 15, 1987\n3. Feyisa Lilesa (Ethiopia) - Born February 1, 1990\n4. Wesley Korir (Kenya) - Born November 15, 1982\n5. Vincent Kipruto (Kenya) - Born September 13, 1987\n6. Robert Kiprono Cheruiyot (Kenya) - Born August 10, 1988\n7. Laban Moiben (Kenya) - Born October 13, 1983\n8. Ridouane Harroufi (Morocco) - Born July 30, 1981\n9. Mike Sayenko (USA) - Born July 12, 1984\n\nNow, we will compare the ages:\n- Jason Hartmann (March 23, 1981)\n- Mike Sayenko (July 12, 1984)\n\nSince Jason Hartmann was born in 1981 and Mike Sayenko in 1984, Mike Sayenko is younger than Jason Hartmann. \n\nThus, the younger American runner at the 2010 Chicago Marathon is Mike Sayenko.",
