The relevant entry states that Cleve is a small agriculturally based town on Central Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, with a population of 738 according to the 2006 census. The airport associated with Cleve is Cleve Airport, which has an IATA code of CVC. Therefore, the IATA code for the airport whose community had a population of 738 at the 2006 census is CVC.",
