        "explanation": "The Monroe Avenue Commercial Buildings, also known as the Monroe Block, were constructed between 1852 and 1911. This historic district was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1974 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The decline of these buildings was influenced by several significant events, including the completion of the Renaissance Center in 1977, which shifted urban focus away from Monroe Avenue. Economic downturns and changing consumer behavior also contributed to their decline, as did the demolition of surrounding structures that fragmented the urban environment. The National Theatre, built in 1911, is the oldest surviving structure from this historic district, but many of the original buildings have been lost over time due to urban redevelopment and economic factors. The specific timeline of their demise is tied to these events, particularly the urban development initiatives of the late 20th century that led to the loss of many historic buildings in the area.",
