        "explanation": "Liseberg is owned by the Mack family, who are also the owners of Mack Rides, a company that designs and constructs amusement rides. The Mack family owns another prominent amusement park, Europa-Park, located in Rust, Germany. This connection is important as it highlights the ownership structure of these amusement parks. Therefore, the task at hand is to identify other parks owned by the same family as Liseberg. After researching the ownership of Liseberg and confirming the Mack family's ownership of Europa-Park, we can conclude that Europa-Park is the other amusement park owned by the same family as Liseberg.",

            "answer": "To identify the other park owned by the same family as Liseberg, which contains the Helix roller coaster, we need to clarify the ownership structure of Liseberg and its connections to other amusement parks. \n\n1. **Ownership of Liseberg**: Liseberg amusement park, located in Gothenburg, Sweden, is owned by Liseberg AB, which is a municipal enterprise under the City of Gothenburg. This means that Liseberg is not privately owned by a family but is publicly owned.\n\n2. **Connection to Mack Rides**: The Helix roller coaster at Liseberg was manufactured by Mack Rides, a German company known for designing and constructing amusement rides. The family that owns Mack Rides, the Mack family, also owns Europa-Park, which is located in Rust, Germany.\n\n3. **Identifying Other Parks**: Since Liseberg itself does not have a family ownership structure, the other park owned by the same family as Liseberg, through the connection with Mack Rides, is Europa-Park. This is the only other amusement park directly associated with the family that owns Mack Rides.\n\nIn conclusion, the investigation reveals that while Liseberg is publicly owned, the family linked to the ownership of Mack Rides, which constructed a ride at Liseberg, also owns Europa-Park. Therefore, the other park owned by the same family as Liseberg is Europa-Park.",
