While the specific date of foundation is unconfirmed in some sources , in a 1917 analysis for the Royal Irish Academy , church historian J. H. Bernard suggests a foundation date of 3 December 1200 . Once established , the abbey was colonised by monks from the Cistercian abbey at Tintern in Monmouthshire , Wales , of which Marshal was also patron . To distinguish the two , the mother house in Wales was sometimes known as Tintern Major and the abbey in Ireland as Tintern de Voto ( Tintern of the vow ) . After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the abbey and its grounds were granted to firstly to Sir James Croft , and then in 1575 to Anthony Colclough of Staffordshire , a soldier of Henry VIII . His descendants became the Colclough Baronets . The final member of the Colclough family to reside at Tintern was Lucey Marie Biddulph Colclough who donated the abbey to the Irish state . Between 1982 and 2007 , the National Monuments service of the Office of Public Works undertook a number of excavation and heritage development efforts at the abbey , including special conservation measures for local bat colonies .
