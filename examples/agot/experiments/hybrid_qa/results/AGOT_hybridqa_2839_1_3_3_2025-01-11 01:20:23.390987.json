        "explanation": "To answer the question regarding the mountain range bordering Italy, which had a trio score of 19.750 in the Aerobic Gymnastics European Championships of 2009, we first identify the relevant country and its geographical features. The trio that scored 19.750 is associated with Italy, as indicated by the data provided. Italy is bordered by several mountain ranges, with the most significant being the Alps, which run along the northern border of the country. The Alps are a major mountain range in Europe, extending across several countries including France, Switzerland, and Austria, and they play a crucial role in Italy's geography. Additionally, while the Apennines run through the length of Italy, they do not form a border with other countries. Therefore, the primary mountain range that borders Italy is the Alps.",

The entry for the score of 19.750 lists the trio as 'Dorian Alimelie, Mathieu Deliers, David Orta' and associates them with 'France'. \n\nNext, we need to determine the mountain range that borders France. France is bordered by several mountain ranges, with the most notable being the Alps to the east and the Pyrenees to the south. \n\nThus, the country associated with the score of 19.750 is France, and the relevant mountain ranges that border France are the Alps and the Pyrenees.",
