The only team identified with a venue capacity of 3,000 is **Abdish-Ata Kant**, which plays at **Stadion Sportkompleks Abdysh-Ata** located in **Kant**, Kyrgyzstan. On the other hand, the teams based in Bishkek include **FC Alga Bishkek**, **FC Dordoi Bishkek**, **FC-95 Bishkek (Isik-Kol)**, and **FC-96 Bishkek (Manas Talas)**, among others. None of these Bishkek-based teams have a venue capacity of 3,000; they all have larger capacities (10,000 and above). Therefore, there are no teams that meet both criteria of having a venue capacity of 3,000 and being based in Bishkek.",

            "answer": "To identify which team with a venue capacity of 3,000 plays in Bishkek, we first extract the relevant teams and their details from the provided context. \n\n1. **Extract Teams with Venue Capacity of 3,000**: From the data, the only team identified with a venue capacity of 3,000 is **Abdish-Ata Kant**, which plays at **Stadion Sportkompleks Abdysh-Ata** located in Kant, Kyrgyzstan. \n\n2. **List Teams Based in Bishkek**: The teams based in Bishkek include:\n   - **FC Alga Bishkek** (Dynamo Stadion, capacity 10,000)\n   - **FC Dordoi Bishkek** (Dolen Omurzakov Stadium, capacity 23,000)\n   - **FC-95 Bishkek (Isik-Kol)**\n   - **FC-96 Bishkek (Manas Talas)**\n   - **FC Issyk Kol Karakol** (though based in Karakol, it is mentioned in the context of Bishkek)\n\n3. **Cross-Reference**: After cross-referencing the teams with a venue capacity of 3,000 and those based in Bishkek, it is clear that none of the teams based in Bishkek have a venue capacity of 3,000. The only team with that capacity, Abdish-Ata Kant, is located in Kant, not Bishkek.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, there are no teams that meet both criteria of having a venue capacity of 3,000 and being based in Bishkek.",
