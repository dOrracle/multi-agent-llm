Based on the previous tasks, the district that meets these criteria is Schwaz, which indeed borders Bavaria to the north and is adjacent to the other specified districts. The vehicle registration code associated with Schwaz, as verified from the context table, is 'SZ'.

According to the context table, the vehicle registration code for Kitzb\u00fchel is **KB**.\n\nThus, the vehicle registration code for the political district that borders Bavaria in the north and the districts of Kufstein, Kitzb\u00fchel, and Pinzgau in the east is **KB**.",
