        "explanation": "The Northern Territory Football Club, also known as NT Thunder, is located in Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia. Darwin is situated on the Timor Sea, which is a significant body of water that borders the city. The Timor Sea is part of the Arafura Sea and is located to the north of Darwin. Additionally, Darwin Harbour, which is an inlet of the Timor Sea, further emphasizes the city's coastal geography. Therefore, the body of water that borders Darwin, and consequently the Northern Territory Football Club, is the Timor Sea.",

            "answer": "To determine the body of water that borders Darwin, we analyze the geographical features of the area. Darwin is located in the Northern Territory of Australia and is situated on the Timor Sea, which is part of the Arafura Sea. This coastal location significantly influences the climate, ecology, and economy of Darwin. The Timor Sea provides access to maritime activities and is a crucial part of the city's identity and development. Therefore, the body of water that borders Darwin is the Timor Sea.",
