According to the data, Trazodone is used to treat major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and, importantly, it is indicated for treating alcohol dependence when used in combination with other medications. Therefore, the specific substance dependency that Trazodone addresses is alcohol dependence. This information is critical as it directly correlates the SARI classification of Trazodone with its therapeutic applications, particularly in the context of substance dependency treatment.",

            "answer": "Trazodone is a SARI antidepressant that is used to treat major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and alcohol dependence when used in combination with other medications. It is classified as a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI), which means it works by blocking certain serotonin receptors while also inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. This dual action contributes to its effectiveness in treating depression and anxiety, as well as its role in managing alcohol dependence. \n\nCommon side effects of Trazodone include dry mouth, dizziness, and headache, while more serious side effects can include suicidal thoughts and irregular heart rates. Overall, Trazodone is a versatile medication that addresses multiple mental health issues, particularly in patients with co-occurring conditions.",
