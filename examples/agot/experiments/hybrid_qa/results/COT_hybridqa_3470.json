    "explanation": "In the provided data, the relevant seasons are the second season (1996-97) and the ninth season (2003-04). The winner of the Pro Player of the Year title for the second season (1996-97) was Paul McCabe from Canada. The data does not provide explicit information on the winner for the ninth season, but it states that Gabriel Nassif was proclaimed Pro Player of the Year after the third year of Kai Budde's dominance. Since the data does not mention a Canadian winning the title in the ninth season, we conclude that the 1996-97 season had a winner from Canada, while no Canadian winner is mentioned for the ninth season.",
    "answer": "The second season (1996-97) had a winner from Canada."
