Opened in 2002 , it serves as the mother church for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles , as well as the seat of Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Horacio G\u00f3mez . The structure replaced the Cathedral of Saint Vibiana , which was severely damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake . Under Cardinal Roger Mahony , Our Lady of the Angels was begun in 1998 and formally opened in September 2002 . There was considerable controversy over both its deconstructivist and modern design and exceptional costs incurred in its construction and furnishing , as well as the archdiocese 's decision to build a crypt under the Cathedral . The Cathedral is named in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary under the patronal title of Our Lady of the Angels , echoing the full name of the original settlement of Los Angeles ( Spanish : El Pueblo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles , or The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels ) . The Cathedral is widely known for enshrining the relics of Saint Vibiana and tilma piece of Our Lady of Guadalupe .
