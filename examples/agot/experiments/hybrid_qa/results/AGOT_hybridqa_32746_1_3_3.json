        "explanation": "To consolidate the findings regarding the wattage of the highest AM frequency, we first identify the highest AM frequency from the provided data. The highest AM frequency is 1140 kHz, which corresponds to the call sign CHRB. According to the data, CHRB broadcasts at a daytime power of 50,000 watts and a nighttime power of 46,000 watts. Therefore, when the frequency is the highest AM frequency (1140 kHz), the call sign CHRB has a daytime wattage of 50,000 watts. This wattage is significant as it indicates the power output during the day, which is typically higher than at night due to broadcasting regulations and signal propagation conditions.",
