    "explanation": "To find the West Coast Conference team with a nickname 'Pilots' and double-digit losses, we can look for entries in the data that mention both characteristics. The only relevant entry states: 'The Portland Pilots is the nickname for athletics at the University of Portland. The Pilots compete in the West Coast Conference (WCC) at the NCAA Division I level.' Additionally, their record of '20-11' shows that they had double-digit losses. Those 11 losses confirm that the team had double-digit losses in that season, as '11' is more than '10'. Therefore, the name of the team that fits these criteria is the Portland Pilots.",
    "answer": "Portland"
