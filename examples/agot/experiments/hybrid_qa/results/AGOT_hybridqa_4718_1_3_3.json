        "explanation": "To determine the duration over which the 2009 title \"Things to Come\" was released, we first identify the relevant years involved in this calculation. The title was released in 2009, and the earliest year mentioned in the dataset is 1992. To calculate the total span of years, we use the formula: \n\n\\[ \\text{Span} = \\text{Latest Year} - \\text{Earliest Year} + 1 \\] \n\nSubstituting the values: \n\\[ \\text{Span} = 2009 - 1992 + 1 = 18 \\] \n\nThus, the title \"Things to Come\" was active over a span of 18 years, from 1992 to 2009 inclusive. This means that the title was released over a period of 18 years, considering the range from the earliest album release in 1992 to the year of the title's release in 2009.",
