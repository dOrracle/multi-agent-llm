        "explanation": "The venue with a capacity of 17,950 is the Xfinity Center, which hosted events in 2004 and 2005. The attendance figures for these events are as follows: In 2004, the attendance was 9,275, and in 2005, it was not available (N/A). Since the question specifically asks for the attendance of the event held at this venue, the relevant figure is the attendance from 2004, which is 9,275. This attendance is below the venue's capacity, indicating that the event did not reach full capacity. Therefore, the attendance for the event at the Xfinity Center in 2004 is 9,275, which is the answer to the question about the attendance of the event held at the venue with a capacity of 17,950.",

The attendance figures for these events are as follows: \n- In 2004, the attendance was 18,424. \n- In 2005, the attendance was 9,275. \n\nSince the question specifically asks for the attendance of the event held at the venue with a capacity of 17,950, the relevant figure is the attendance from 2004, which is 18,424. However, it is important to note that this attendance exceeds the venue's capacity, indicating a potential discrepancy in the data. The attendance for 2005, which is 9,275, is below the venue's capacity and is also relevant. Therefore, the attendance for the event at the Xfinity Center in 2004 is 18,424, but further verification may be needed due to the overcapacity issue.",
