    "explanation": "To determine which third-placed team in the 1960s was founded first, we look at the clubs that finished in third place from 1960 to 1969. The data includes: 1963: Skeid (founded in 1915), 1964: Fredrikstad (founded in 1903), 1965: V\u00e5lerenga (founded in 1913), 1966: Skeid (again, founded in 1915), 1967: Skeid (again), 1968: Lyn (founded in 1896), 1969: Fredrikstad (again). Among these clubs, Fredrikstad was founded in 1903 and Lyn in 1896. Since Lyn (1896) is the earliest founded team compared to others listed for the 1960s, it is concluded that Lyn is the earliest established club out of all those that secured third place in the 1960s.",
