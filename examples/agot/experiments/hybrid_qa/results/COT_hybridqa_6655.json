    "explanation": "The village located at a height of 1,597 metres above sea level is Champoussin, which is in the canton of Valais, Switzerland. To find a mountain pass in the same country, we can refer to the data: one relevant mountain pass is the Col de Cou, which connects Champ\u00e9ry, also in the Valais canton, to Morzine in France. Another relevant pass is the Col de Balme, which connects Switzerland to France but is also located near the same region. Examining the data, Col de Cou (the Col de Coux) is indeed a pass within Switzerland, making it applicable as an answer.",
