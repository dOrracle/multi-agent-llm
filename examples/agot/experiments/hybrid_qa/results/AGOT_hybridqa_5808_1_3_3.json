            "answer": "To identify the player who went to school at Arizona and played for a team in 1975, we first focus on the notable players associated with the University of Arizona from the 1966 College Baseball All-America Team. The primary player identified is Reggie Jackson, who attended the University of Arizona. Next, we need to determine which team he played for in 1975. Historical records indicate that Reggie Jackson played for the New York Yankees during the 1975 MLB season. Therefore, the player who went to school at Arizona, Reggie Jackson, played for the New York Yankees in 1975.",

            "answer": "To identify the team that the player from Arizona played for in 1975, we first focus on notable players who attended the University of Arizona during that period. The most prominent player associated with Arizona is Reggie Jackson, who played in Major League Baseball. In 1975, Reggie Jackson played for the Oakland Athletics, which is a key detail in determining the team affiliation of an Arizona player during that year.\n\nNext, we gather information about other potential players from Arizona who might have been active in 1975. Players such as Jim Hibbs and Eddie Leon were also associated with the University of Arizona, but their specific team affiliations in 1975 need to be confirmed through further research.\n\nThe next step involves cross-referencing the identified players with the rosters of teams active in 1975 to ensure we have a comprehensive understanding of which players were associated with which teams. This includes confirming the rosters of the Oakland Athletics and any other teams that may have had Arizona alumni.\n\nIn conclusion, the primary focus remains on Reggie Jackson, who is confirmed to have played for the Oakland Athletics in 1975. Further exploration may reveal additional players, but Jackson's affiliation is the most significant at this stage.",
