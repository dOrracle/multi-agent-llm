Annis. This is derived from the information stating that B.J. Annis is married to Georgia Hart, the daughter of Stu and Helen Hart.\n\n2. **Identifying the First Child of Stu and Helen Hart**: The first child of Stu and Helen Hart is Smith Hart. This is confirmed by the information that states Smith was the first of their twelve children.\n\n3. **Cross-referencing**: Since Georgia Hart is the daughter of Stu and Helen Hart, she is indeed a Child-in-law of the Hart family. Smith Hart, being the first child of Stu and Helen, does not directly relate to the Child-in-law in terms of marriage but is a sibling to Georgia Hart.\n\nThus, the cross-referencing confirms that Georgia Hart is the Child-in-law related to the first child of Stu and Helen Hart, which is Smith Hart.",
