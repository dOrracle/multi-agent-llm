        "explanation": "To consolidate the findings regarding the third-placed teams in the Norwegian football league during the 1960s, we first identify the teams that finished in third place each year from 1960 to 1969. The identified teams are: 1. **1963**: **Lyn** 2. **1964**: **Fredrikstad** 3. **1965**: **V\u00e5lerenga** 4. **1966**: **Skeid** 5. **1967**: **Rosenborg** 6. **1968**: **Lyn** 7. **1969**: **Rosenborg**. Next, we compile the founding years of these teams: - **Lyn**: Founded in **1896** - **Fredrikstad**: Founded in **1903** - **V\u00e5lerenga**: Founded in **1913** - **Skeid**: Founded in **1915** - **Rosenborg**: Founded in **1917**. Now, we compare the founding years: Lyn (1896), Fredrikstad (1903), V\u00e5lerenga (1913), Skeid (1915), and Rosenborg (1917). From this analysis, **Lyn**, founded in **1896**, is the earliest founded club among the identified third place teams in the 1960s.
