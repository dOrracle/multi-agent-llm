        "explanation": "The 2009 album 'Things to Come' by Rez Abbasi was recorded in late 2008 and early 2009. To determine the number of years over which this album was released, we need to consider the time frame of its recording and release. Since the album was recorded at the end of 2008 and released in 2009, it spans two years: 2008 and 2009. Thus, the total number of years over which the 2009 title was released is 2 years.",

            "answer": "The task requires consolidating findings regarding the range of years between the earliest and latest album releases by Rudresh Mahanthappa. The extracted album release years are: 1992, 1994, 1998, 2001, 2003, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2007, 2008, 2008, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2010, 2011, and 2011. The earliest album release year is 1992, and the latest is 2011. The range of years is calculated by subtracting the earliest year from the latest year: 2011 - 1992 = 19 years. Therefore, the range of years between the earliest and latest album releases by Rudresh Mahanthappa is 19 years.",
