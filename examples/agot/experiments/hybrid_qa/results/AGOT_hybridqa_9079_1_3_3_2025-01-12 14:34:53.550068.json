Since the 2004 attendance is the only relevant data point available for the Xfinity Center, it serves as the final attendance figure for the event held at this venue.

The venue that matches this capacity is the Xfinity Center, which is the home of the University of Maryland Terrapins men's and women's basketball teams. The attendance figures for events held at this venue are as follows:\n\n- In 2004, the attendance was 18,424.\n- In 2005, the attendance was 9,275.\n\nSince both attendance figures exceed the venue's capacity, we will consider the most recent attendance figure from the data, which is 9,275 for the year 2005. Therefore, the attendance for the event at the Xfinity Center is 9,275.",
