            "answer": "The Marine Security Guards (MSG) have a significant historical role in U.S. history, particularly in the context of embassy security and international relations. The formal establishment of the Marine Security Guard program began with the Foreign Service Act of 1946, which allowed the Secretary of the Navy to assign Marines to serve as custodians at diplomatic posts. This marked the beginning of a structured approach to embassy security, which had previously relied on ad-hoc arrangements.\n\nThe first Marine Security Guards were deployed in 1949 to American embassies in Tangier and Bangkok, and the program has evolved over the decades to adapt to changing global security needs. The Marine Corps took on the primary training responsibility for these guards in 1954, emphasizing the importance of their role in protecting U.S. interests abroad.\n\nNotable historical events involving Marine Security Guards include their presence during significant diplomatic crises, such as the Iran hostage crisis in 1979 and the 2012 Benghazi attack, which highlighted the need for increased security measures at U.S. embassies. In response to the Benghazi attack, Congress mandated an increase in the number of Marine Security Guards, reflecting the ongoing importance of their role in safeguarding American diplomats and facilities.\n\nAmong the notable individuals who served as Marine Security Guards is Darwin Judge, an Eagle Scout who tragically became one of the last two U.S. servicemen killed in the Vietnam War. His story is emblematic of the sacrifices made by Marine Security Guards in the line of duty, underscoring their commitment to protecting U.S. personnel and interests around the world. Judge was from Marshalltown, Iowa, linking his personal history to the broader narrative of Marine Security Guards in U.S. history.",
