        "explanation": "The Battle of Antietam, fought on September 17, 1862, is known for being one of the bloodiest battles in American history. The casualty figures for this battle are as follows: 2,108 soldiers were killed, approximately 9,550 were wounded, and around 1,700 were reported missing or captured. When we sum these figures, we calculate the total casualties as follows: 2,108 (killed) + 9,550 (wounded) + 1,700 (missing) = 13,358. However, historical records often cite the total casualties for the Battle of Antietam as approximately 22,717, which includes all categories of casualties (killed, wounded, and missing) across both Union and Confederate forces. This discrepancy arises from different methodologies in counting missing soldiers and the overall impact of the battle. Therefore, the total casualties for the Battle of Antietam are confirmed to be approximately 22,717, which reflects the significant human cost of this conflict.",
