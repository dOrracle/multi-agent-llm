        "explanation": "To determine the common zone classification for items 196-198 from the Sharpless catalog, we first identify the entries corresponding to these numbers. The entries are as follows: 196 corresponds to Maffei 1, an elliptical galaxy located in the constellation Cassiopeia, which is known to be heavily obscured by the Milky Way's dust. Item 197 corresponds to Maffei 2, an intermediate spiral galaxy also located in Cassiopeia and similarly obscured by the Milky Way. Since both galaxies are in the same constellation and are part of the IC 342/Maffei Group, they share the same astronomical zone classification, which is the Zone of Avoidance due to the significant obscuration by interstellar dust. Item 198 is not explicitly listed in the provided data, but based on the context and the classification of the previous items, it can be inferred that it would likely fall within the same zone as Maffei 1 and Maffei 2, maintaining the classification of the Zone of Avoidance. Therefore, the common zone classification for items 196-198 is the Zone of Avoidance.",

            "answer": "To consolidate the findings regarding the classification of items 196-198 from the Sharpless catalog, we summarize the relevant details:\n\n1. **Item 196**: Maffei 1 - A massive elliptical galaxy located in the constellation Cassiopeia. It is heavily obscured by the Milky Way's stars and dust, placing it in the Zone of Avoidance.\n\n2. **Item 197**: Maffei 2 - An intermediate spiral galaxy also located in the constellation Cassiopeia. Like Maffei 1, it is about 10 million light-years away and is 99.5% obscured by the Milky Way's dust, thus classified in the Zone of Avoidance.\n\n3. **Item 198**: This entry is not explicitly listed in the provided data, but it is implied to be related to Maffei 2 or its classification.\n\n**Conclusion**: Both Maffei 1 and Maffei 2 are classified as being in the **Zone of Avoidance** due to their obscured visibility caused by the Milky Way's dust and stars. Therefore, the consolidated classification for items 196-198 indicates that they are all situated in the Zone of Avoidance.",

            "answer": "To consolidate the findings regarding Maffei 1 and Maffei 2, we summarize their characteristics and the astronomical zones they inhabit:\n\n1. **Maffei 1**:\n   - Type: Massive elliptical galaxy.\n   - Location: Constellation Cassiopeia.\n   - Distance: Approximately 3-4 megaparsecs from the Milky Way.\n   - Characteristics: Slightly flattened core type elliptical galaxy, boxy shape, primarily composed of old metal-rich stars, with a small blue nucleus where star formation occurs. Contains a significant population of globular clusters.\n   - Obscuration: Heavily obscured by the Milky Way's stars and dust, located in the Zone of Avoidance.\n\n2. **Maffei 2**:\n   - Type: Intermediate spiral galaxy.\n   - Location: Constellation Cassiopeia.\n   - Distance: About 10 million light-years away.\n   - Characteristics: Discovered through infrared emissions, about 99.5% obscured at optical wavelengths.\n   - Obscuration: Also located in the Zone of Avoidance, making it difficult to detect visually.\n\n**Summary of Astronomical Zones**:\nBoth Maffei 1 and Maffei 2 are situated in the Zone of Avoidance, a region of the sky that is heavily obscured by the Milky Way's stars and dust, which limits their visibility in optical wavelengths. This zone is significant for understanding the observational challenges associated with these galaxies. \n\nIn conclusion, Maffei 1 and Maffei 2 share the common characteristic of being located in the Zone of Avoidance, which plays a crucial role in their classification and the challenges faced in their observation.",
