We will compare this number with the employee counts of the companies listed in the provided data.\n\nFrom the data:\n- ISS: 500,000 employees (2018)\n- A.P. M\u00f8ller-Maersk: 80,220 employees (2018)\n- Nokia: 103,000 employees (2018)\n- Ericsson: 95,000 employees (2018)\n- Volvo: 570,000 employees (2018)\n- H&M: 132,000 employees (2018)\n- Electrolux: 64,874 employees (2018)\n- Sandvik: 42,000 employees (2018)\n- Skanska: 52,557 employees (2018)\n\nFrom this comparison, the companies with more employees than Securitas are:\n1. ISS: 500,000 employees\n2. Volvo: 570,000 employees\n\nNext, we extract the 2018 revenue for these companies:\n- ISS: DKK 73.5 billion\n- A.P. M\u00f8ller-Maersk: US $39 billion\n- Nokia: \u20ac23 billion\n- Ericsson: (not provided)\n- Volvo: (not provided)\n- H&M: (not provided)\n- Electrolux: (not provided)\n- Sandvik: 91 billion SEK\n- Skanska: (not provided)\n\nSince the task specifies to extract the revenue of the identified company, we focus on the companies with more employees than Securitas. The revenues for ISS and A.P.
