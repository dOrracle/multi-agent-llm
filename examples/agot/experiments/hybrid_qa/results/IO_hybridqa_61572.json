    "explanation": "The question asks about the \"demise of Monroe Avenue Commercial Buildings\" in terms of a noted person. The answer is linked to the history of structures along Monroe Avenue, specifically noting the National Theatre, which was designed by Albert Kahn and became the oldest surviving theatre in Detroit. This indicates that Kahn's architectural work is notably recognized within the historical context of these buildings. While the question's wording suggests looking for a specific date of death or demise associated with a person, in the context provided, no specific person's death is documented in the information about the Monroe Avenue Commercial Buildings. Albert Kahn, the architect, passed away in 1942, relevant to the historical context of these buildings, but it's unclear if this directly pertains to the commercial buildings themselves.",
    "answer": "No specific individual's demise is mentioned; however, Albert Kahn (the architect) died in 1942."
