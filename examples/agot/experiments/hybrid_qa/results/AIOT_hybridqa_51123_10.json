The series ran for ten seasons on Fox from October 4 , 1990 , to May 17 , 2000 , and is the longest-running show produced by Spelling . It is the first of six television series in the Beverly Hills , 90210 franchise and follows the lives of a group of friends living in the upscale and star-studded community of Beverly Hills , California , as they transition from high school to college and into the adult world . 90210 refers to one of the city 's five ZIP codes . The initial premise of the show was based on the adjustment and culture shock that twins Brandon ( Jason Priestley ) and Brenda Walsh ( Shannen Doherty ) experienced when they and their parents , Jim ( James Eckhouse ) and Cindy ( Carol Potter ) , moved from Minneapolis , Minnesota , to Beverly Hills , California . In addition to chronicling the characters ' friendships and romantic relationships , the show addressed topical issues such as sex , date rape , homophobia , animal rights , alcoholism , drug abuse , domestic violence , eating disorders , antisemitism , racism , teenage suicide , teenage pregnancy , and AIDS . After poor ratings during its first season , the series gained popularity during the summer of 1991 , when Fox aired a special summer season of the show while most other series were in reruns . Viewership increased dramatically , and 90210 became one of Fox 's top shows when it returned that fall . The show became a global pop culture phenomenon with its cast members , particularly Jason Priestley and Luke Perry , who became teen idols ; the series also made actresses Shannen Doherty and Jennie Garth household names in the US . The show is credited with creating or popularizing the teen soap genre that many other successful television shows followed in the years to come . The show had many cast changes ; Jennie Garth , Tori Spelling , Brian Austin Green , and Ian Ziering were the only actors to appear during its entire run and appeared on the first episode of Melrose Place . On February 27 , 2019 , it was announced that a six-episode reboot has been ordered by Fox and that the show would simply be titled BH90210 .\"}]}, {'value': 'Tal Weaver', 'urls': []}, {'value': 'Episode : Leading from the Heart', 'urls': [{'url': '/wiki/List_of_Beverly_Hills,_90210_episodes', 'summary': 'Beverly Hills , 90210 is a United States primetime teen drama which ran on the FOX network for ten years , from October 4 , 1990 to May 17 , 2000 .

Throughout its six-year run , the show received contributions from various producers , writers , and directors , principally Michael Patrick King . Set and filmed in New York City and based on Candace Bushnell 's 1997 book of the same name , the show follows the lives of a group of four women - three in their mid-thirties and one in her forties - who , despite their different natures and ever-changing sex lives , remain inseparable and confide in each other . Starring Sarah Jessica Parker ( as Carrie Bradshaw ) and co-starring Kim Cattrall ( as Samantha Jones ) , Kristin Davis ( as Charlotte York ) , and Cynthia Nixon ( as Miranda Hobbes ) , the quirky series had multiple continuing storylines that tackled relevant and modern social issues such as sexuality , safe sex , promiscuity , and femininity , while exploring the difference between friendships and romantic relationships . The deliberate omission of the better part of the early lives of the four women was the writers ' way of exploring social life - from sex to relationships - through each of their four very different , individual perspectives . Sex and the City has received both acclaim and criticism for its subjects and characters , and is credited with helping to increase HBO 's popularity as a network . The series has won several accolades , including seven of its 54 Emmy Award nominations , eight of its 24 Golden Globe Award nominations , and three of its 11 Screen Actors Guild Award nominations . The series placed fifth on Entertainment Weekly 's New TV Classics list , and has been listed as one of the best television series of all time by Time in 2007 and TV Guide in 2013 .
