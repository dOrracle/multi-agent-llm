        "explanation": "To determine the institution whose primary conference stopped sponsoring college football after the 2000 season, we first identify the relevant conference, which is the Big West Conference. This conference ceased football sponsorship after the 2000 season. The University of California, Davis (UC Davis) was a member of the Big West Conference during that time. Therefore, UC Davis is the institution that fits the criteria of having its primary conference stop sponsoring college football after the 2000 season. This conclusion is supported by the previous tasks that confirmed UC Davis's membership in the Big West Conference and the conference's discontinuation of football sponsorship.",

            "answer": "The Big West Conference was the last collegiate athletic conference to discontinue sponsorship of college football, officially ceasing its football operations after the 2000 season. This decision marked a significant moment in college athletics, as the Big West had been a notable conference in the realm of college football. The conference's decision to stop sponsoring football was influenced by various factors, including shifting priorities among member institutions and the overall landscape of college athletics at the time.\n\nFollowing the Big West, the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) became the next conference to discontinue football, doing so after the 2012-13 season. This timeline highlights the Big West's position as the last conference to end its football sponsorship, making it a pivotal point in the history of college football sponsorship among conferences.",
