        "explanation": "Maffei 1 and Maffei 2 are both located in the Zone of Avoidance, which is characterized by significant obscuration due to the Milky Way's stars and dust. Maffei 1 is classified as a massive elliptical galaxy, while Maffei 2 is classified as an intermediate spiral galaxy. Maffei 1 has a boxy shape and contains a population of old metal-rich stars, along with a tiny blue nucleus where star formation is still occurring. Maffei 2, on the other hand, is heavily obscured, with approximately 99.5% of its light blocked by foreground dust clouds, making it barely detectable at optical wavelengths. Both galaxies belong to the IC 342/Maffei Group, which is the closest galaxy group to the Local Group. The implications of their positions in the Zone of Avoidance are significant as they limit observational studies and understanding of these galaxies.",

            "answer": "The findings from the research indicate that both Maffei 1 and Maffei 2 are located in the Zone of Avoidance, which is characterized by significant obscuration due to the Milky Way's stars and dust. Maffei 2, specifically, is classified as an intermediate spiral galaxy and is approximately 10 million light-years away. It is heavily obscured, with about 99.5% of its light blocked by foreground dust clouds, making it difficult to observe at optical wavelengths. The implications of this obscuration are profound, as it limits our ability to study these galaxies in detail and affects their classification and understanding within the context of the IC 342/Maffei Group, which is the nearest galaxy group to the Local Group. Overall, the Zone of Avoidance presents significant observational challenges for both Maffei 1 and Maffei 2.",

            "answer": "The item in the astronomical catalog numbered between 196 and 198 is Maffei 1 and Maffei 2, both of which are located in the Zone of Avoidance. This area is characterized by heavy obscuration due to the Milky Way's stars and dust, making these galaxies difficult to observe. Specifically, Maffei 1 is a massive elliptical galaxy, while Maffei 2 is classified as an intermediate spiral galaxy, and both are significantly obscured, with Maffei 2 being about 99.5% obscured by the Milky Way's foreground dust clouds. This classification and understanding of their location in the Zone of Avoidance are supported by the data collected and analyzed in previous tasks regarding these galaxies.",

            "answer": "The Zone of Avoidance refers to a region of the sky that is obscured by the Milky Way's stars and dust, making it difficult to observe distant galaxies located within this region. Both Maffei 1 and Maffei 2 are located in the Zone of Avoidance. Maffei 1 is a massive elliptical galaxy that is heavily obscured by the Milky Way, preventing it from being easily observed. Similarly, Maffei 2 is an intermediate spiral galaxy that is about 99.5% obscured by foreground dust clouds from the Milky Way, making it barely detectable at optical wavelengths. Therefore, the relevance of the Zone of Avoidance to Maffei 1 and Maffei 2 is that both galaxies are significantly hidden from view due to the interstellar material of our own galaxy.",
