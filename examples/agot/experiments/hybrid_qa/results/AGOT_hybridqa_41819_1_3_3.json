            "answer": "Romell Broom, born June 4, 1956, is an American man convicted of murder, kidnapping, and rape. He was convicted in 1984 for the abduction and murder of Tryna Middleton, a 14-year-old girl in East Cleveland, Ohio. Broom was on death row for 34 years and 106 days before he agreed to a DNA test in 2003 to prove his innocence. However, the test results did not exonerate him, indicating a likelihood of him being the donor at 1 in 2.3 million, suggesting that eight or nine other black males could have the same DNA profile. Broom has repeatedly requested independent DNA retesting and a change of legal representation.",
