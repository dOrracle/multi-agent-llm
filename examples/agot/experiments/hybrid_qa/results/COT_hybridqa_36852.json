    "explanation": "Jarno Trulli was replaced by Giancarlo Fisichella at Renault. In the results from the 1999 British Grand Prix, Trulli's position was 14th and he was driving for the Prost team, whereas Fisichella did not appear in this context based on the data provided. Trulli was more successful during his time at Renault compared to his previous team, which correlates to the placements in the race results. Based on the current table, we conclude that Fisichella's performance is not listed since he was not in the races at that time reflecting for the Renault team and starts after this season.",
    "answer": "14th"
