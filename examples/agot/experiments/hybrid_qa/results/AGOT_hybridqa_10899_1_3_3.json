        "explanation": "The Indian National Congress (INC) was founded in 1885 by a group of nationalists, with Allan Octavian Hume being one of the most prominent figures in its establishment. Other key figures included Womesh Chunder Bonnerjee, who became the first president of the Congress, and Dadabhai Naoroji, who was instrumental in advocating for Indian issues in Britain. The formation of the INC marked the beginning of the first modern nationalist movement in the British Empire in Asia and Africa, and it played a crucial role in the Indian independence movement, especially under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi from the late 19th century onward. The political context of its founding included a growing demand for civil and political rights for Indians, as well as increasing discontent with British colonial rule.\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was founded by Syama Prasad Mukherjee in 1951 as the Bharatiya Jana Sangh. This organization later transformed into the BJP in 1980 after merging with several other parties to form the Janata Party and subsequently reconvening as the BJP. The socio-political environment during the 1950s was characterized by the dominance of the Indian National Congress, which played a significant role in India's independence and governance. The rise of Hindu nationalism, particularly through the influence of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), also contributed to the BJP's formation, as it provided a platform for promoting Hindu identity and values in the political sphere.",

            "answer": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was founded by Syama Prasad Mukherjee in 1951. This information is essential for understanding the origins of the BJP and its ideological foundations. The current Members of Parliament for Karnataka include members from both the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party, such as Rajeev Chandrasekhar and Nirmala Sitharaman. The Indian National Congress was founded in 1885 by A.O. Hume. Therefore, the founders of the parties relevant to the current MPs in Karnataka are Syama Prasad Mukherjee for the BJP and A.O. Hume for the Indian National Congress.",
